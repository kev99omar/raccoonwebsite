	<h1>Statement</h1>
	<p>This was the first time I ever attempted this project for the final. I found it very challenging, but I tried to do the best that I can. I used a program to do my website called Sublime Text 3. Then I submitted on GitHub to open an official website that I created. My inspiration was about a character I called Raccoon who lived in a forest. I did the pseudo-documentary because I found that option the easiest, the reason why is with the time I had left, I didn’t think I would have enough time to finish it. The short video is titled Racoon in the forest. My story is about a Raccoon who ran into the forest to see its friends. The story ended when Raccoon’s friends were left. I used frames and made some changes to fix the animation such as frames and qualities. I used my storyboard and worked on this all by myself. I did not change any scenes of my storyboard before to do my real animation on aftereffects. I tried to modify some issues on the website such as spelling grammar errors. The project that I finished is very necessary to present in the final semester.</p>
